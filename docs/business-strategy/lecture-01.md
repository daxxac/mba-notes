# Business Strategy

## Course Overview

**Course Focus:** Strategic thinking and long-term business planning

---

## What is Business Strategy?

### Core Definition

**Business Strategy** is the integrated set of decisions and actions a company takes to achieve sustainable competitive advantage and superior performance in its market.

**Key Principle:** "Begin with the End in Mind"

### Three Fundamental Questions

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Business Strategy] --> B[WHERE will we compete?]
    A --> C[HOW will we compete?]
    A --> D[HOW will we sustain advantage?]
    B --> B1[Which industries, markets, or customer segments to target]
    C --> C1[Creating and delivering value better or differently than competitors]
    D --> D1[Building long-term capabilities that competitors cannot replicate]
```

### What Strategy IS:

- Making deliberate trade-offs
- Choosing what NOT to do
- Creating a unique value proposition
- Aligning firm's internal capabilities with external market opportunities

### What Strategy IS NOT:

- Only about operational efficiency
- Copying industry best practices (necessary but not sufficient)
- Doing everything

---

## The Trade-Off Principle

**"There are no solutions, just trade-offs"** - Thomas Sowell

This applies to everything in business and life. Understanding trade-offs is fundamental to strategy.

### Examples of Strategic Trade-Offs:

**Walmart:**

- Trade-off: Does NOT cater to wealthy customers
- Result: Walmart family members worth ~$60 billion each
- Focus: Inexpensive goods for middle and lower-middle class

**Porsche/Ferrari:**

- Trade-off: Only sell limited number of cars annually
- Result: High margins, luxury positioning
- Note: Porsche later changed strategy by acquiring Volkswagen

**Apple:**

- Trade-off: Premium pricing excludes budget-conscious customers
- Result: High margins, strong brand loyalty

```mermaid

## Strategy vs. Tactics

### Key Distinctions

| Aspect | Strategy | Tactics |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Time Horizon** | Long-term (months to years) | Short-term (days to months) |
| **Focus** | Overall positioning and competitive advantage | Specific actions and steps |
| **Level of Detail** | Broad, directional decisions | Detailed, actionable plans |
| **Example** | Competing through product differentiation in premium markets | Launching an ad campaign targeting high-income customers |
| **Who Designs It** | Senior executives, leadership teams (CEO, Board, Chief Strategy Officer) | Middle managers, operational teams (COO, CFO, CTO) |
| **Purpose** | Define "where to compete" and "how to win" | Execute specific tasks to achieve strategic objectives |

### Organizational Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Board of Directors] --> B[CEO]
    B --> C[Chief Strategy Officer]
    B --> D[COO - Chief Operating Officer]
    B --> E[CFO - Chief Financial Officer]
    B --> F[CTO - Chief Technology Officer]
    C --> G[Strategy: Long-term thinking]
    D --> H[Tactics: Implementation]
    E --> H
    F --> H
```

**Key Insight:** Strategy gets approved by CEO and Board. Implementation is handled by COO and operational teams.

---

## Strategic Positioning

### Three Approaches to Market Positioning:

1. **Serving few needs of many customers**
   - Example: Jiffy Lube (only car maintenance services)

2. **Serving broad needs of few customers**
   - Example: Bessemer Trust (only ultra-wealthy clients, minimum $5M investment)

3. **Serving broad needs of many customers in a narrow market**
   - Example: Super Mosheva (Jerusalem boutique grocery store in German Colony)

### Creating 'Fit' Among Activities

Strategic positioning attempts to achieve sustainable competitive advantage by preserving what is 'distinctive' about a company.

---

## Critical Strategic Terms

### Operational Effectiveness (OE)

- Performing similar activities **better** than rivals
- Includes but is not limited to efficiency
- **Important:** OE alone is NOT sufficient for long-term strategy
- Can lead to acquisition if done exceptionally well

### Strategic Positioning

- Attempts to achieve sustainable competitive advantage
- Preserves what is 'distinctive' about the company

### Productivity Frontier

- The maximum value a company can deliver at a given cost
- Given the best available technology, skills, and management techniques

### Strategic Objectives

- Measurable goals aligned with mission and vision

### Competitive Advantage

- The edge a firm has that allows it to outperform rivals

### Mission Statement

- Organization's purpose and reason for existence
- **Homework Assignment:** Visit company websites and read mission statements
- Note: Sometimes stated mission differs from actual practice

### Strategic Fit

- Alignment of internal strengths with external opportunities

---

## Industry Selection: The "Where"

Strategy begins with choosing which industry to compete in - this fundamentally shapes everything else.

### Examples of Different Industry Strategies:

**Grocery Store Industry:**

- Margins: 1-2% (worldwide standard for large stores)
- Strategy: High volume, low margins
- Example: Rami Levi (Israel) - multiple stores, cheap prices, thin margins

**Makeup Industry:**

- Margins: Astronomical (extremely high)
- Strategy: Premium pricing, brand positioning

**Construction Industry:**

- Some companies only build roads (highly specialized)
- Some only do foundations
- Strategy: Deep specialization, become the best in narrow field

**Carpentry Example (Tel Aviv):**

- High-end carpentry for luxury apartments
- 6-month waiting list
- Father (80 years old) inspects all work
- Premium pricing, customers don't question costs
- Strategy: Craftsmanship, exclusivity, quality control

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Industry Selection] --> B[High Margin Industries]
    A --> C[Low Margin Industries]
    B --> B1[Makeup: Astronomical margins]
    B --> B2[Luxury goods: High margins]
    C --> C1[Groceries: 1-2% margins]
    C --> C2[Airlines: Thin margins]
    B1 --> D[Different strategies required]
    C1 --> D
```

## The "How": Creating Value

### Key Question:

How will you create and deliver something **better and different** for the customer?

**Critical Point:** If you create something the same as your competitor, you may do okay, but you won't do great.

### Example: Airline Industry Transformation

**Before Deregulation:**

- Prices regulated by governments worldwide
- Only middle-to-upper-middle class could afford tickets
- Uniform service standards

**After Deregulation:**

- Discount airlines emerged
- Strategy: Charge for everything ("charge you for breathing air")
- Result: Made air travel accessible to lower-middle class
- Examples: Different from British Air, Singapore Air (best airline), American Airlines

### How to Keep Competitive Advantage

Once you have distinction and advantage, maintaining it is crucial.

**Apple Example:**

- Constantly changing cables/connectors
- Forces customers to buy new accessories
- Cable production cost: ~$0.05
- Retail price: ~$35
- Strategy: Ecosystem lock-in through proprietary standards

---

## Real-World Strategy Examples

### Apple Inc.

**Business Strategy:**

- Premium design and user-friendly interfaces
- High-margin hardware (iPhone, MacBook, iPad)
- Integration of hardware, software, and services

**Professor's Note:** "It's absolutely brilliant. I appreciate the brilliance of ripping me off to make me buy something else."

### Walmart

**Strategy:**

- Sell very inexpensive goods
- Target customers who cannot afford expensive goods

**Key Tactics:**

- Ruthless negotiation with suppliers
- "This is the price. If you sell to us, we're going to buy more than you can possibly make"
- Lowest prices in the industry - no one pays less
- Some luxury brands (like Prada) refuse to sell to Walmart

**Requirements for Success:**

- Cheap/affordable labor
- Exceptional logistics
- High volume

**Result:** Most profitable family-run business in America

### Toyota → Lexus (Strategy Change)

**Original Strategy:** Make practical, reliable cars (Toyota, Accord)

**Strategy Change:**

- Wanted to enter high-end car market
- Created Lexus brand
- **Key Insight:** A Lexus is really a Toyota with:
  - Better wood
  - Leather seats
  - Enhanced instrumentation
  - Better design
  
**Incremental Cost:** Not much more than an Accord

**Pricing Difference:** Huge markup

**Result:** Brilliant strategy change - captured luxury market while maintaining operational efficiency

### University Strategy Example

**Small Private Universities (U.S.):**

- Were relatively inexpensive
- To raise enrollment: **Raised prices by 20-25%**
- Result: 
  - Enrollment increased 30%
  - Financial aid requests decreased
  - Moved into different class/market segment

**North Carolina University Example:**

- Identical to McDonald's in New York, San Francisco, Dallas
- Same experience, different language
- First owner made enormous fortune

**Key:** Same in-store experience globally

### Tiffany's

## Porter's Competitive Strategies

**Professor Michael Porter:** "The guru of strategy" - Harvard Business School

Every strategy consultant mirrors Porter's work. Required reading for the course.

### Four Generic Competitive Strategies

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Competitive Strategy] --> B[Cost Leadership]
    A --> C[Differentiation]
    A --> D[Cost Focus]
    A --> E[Differentiation Focus]
    B --> F[Broad Market]
    C --> F
    D --> G[Narrow Market]
    E --> G
```

### 1. Cost Leadership

**Goal:** Become the lowest-cost producer in the industry

**How it Works:**

- Achieving economies of scale
- Efficient production and supply chain management
- Tight cost control
- Standardized products targeting price-sensitive customers

**Target Scope:** Broad market

**Examples:**

- **Walmart:** Large-scale operations, efficient logistics, aggressive supplier negotiations
- **Ryanair:** Low-cost airline with minimal frills

### 2. Differentiation

**Goal:** Offer unique products/services that customers perceive as superior

**How it Works:**

- Innovation in design, features, or technology
- Strong brand identity
- Superior quality or customer service
- Unique distribution channels

**Target Scope:** Broad market

**Examples:**

- **Apple:** Sleek product design, user experience, integrated ecosystem
- **Starbucks:** Premium coffee experience with strong branding

### 3. Cost Focus

**Goal:** Apply cost leadership within a specific market segment or niche

**How it Works:**

- Targeting narrow customer group with lower-priced products
- Efficiency and standardization for niche markets

**Target Scope:** Narrow market

**Examples:**

- **Aldi:** Affordable groceries for cost-conscious shoppers, limited product range

### 4. Differentiation Focus

**Goal:** Offer unique products tailored to specific market segment or niche

**How it Works:**

- Deep understanding of niche customer needs
- Customization, exclusivity, or specialized services
- Higher prices justified by uniqueness

**Target Scope:** Narrow market

**Examples:**

- **Rolex:** Premium watches for luxury buyers, emphasizing craftsmanship and exclusivity
- **Tesla (early years):** High-performance electric vehicles for tech-savvy, environmentally conscious consumers
- **Emilio Pucci:** Ultra-high-end fashion stores (Rome), most beautiful stores, experiential shopping

### Summary Table

| Strategy | Competitive Advantage | Target Scope | Example |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|---------|
| Cost Leadership | Lowest cost | Broad market | Walmart |
| Differentiation | Unique product/service | Broad market | Apple |
| Cost Focus | Lowest cost | Narrow market | Aldi |
| Differentiation Focus | Unique product/service | Narrow market | Rolex |

### Critical Warning: "Stuck in the Middle"

Companies must choose a clear strategy and avoid being "stuck in the middle," where they fail to achieve either differentiation or cost leadership effectively, leading to weak competitive positioning.

## Strategy Changes and Adaptations

### When to Change Strategy

**Key Insight:** Most startup companies change strategies fairly early on

**Reasons for Strategy Change:**

1. **Internal factors:** Company learns more about its capabilities
2. **External events:** Market conditions, regulations, competition
3. **Forced changes:** Competitors, technology disruption

**Venture Capitalist Perspective:**

- VCs expect companies to change strategies
- They nod when hearing initial strategy because they know it will likely change
- This is normal and expected

### Example: Strategy Change Necessity

**Company in Israel (name withheld):**

- Hired Chief Strategy Officer from IDF background
- Not originally from the industry
- Older than most executives
- Brought fresh perspective
- Result: Successfully steered company in new direction

**Problem Identified:**

- Revenues remained flat
- Profits declining incrementally each year
- Year 1: Small decline (dismissed as "blip")
- Year 2: Another decline
- Year 3-4: "Oh my god, what are we doing?"
- Costs rising, competition increasing
- Eventually revenues follow profits down

**Solution:**

- Outside perspective from experienced strategist
- Overcame internal resistance ("he's not one of us")
- CEO made courageous choice

### Founder Challenge

**Common Problem:**

- Founders get "married" to their original idea
- Spent years in school developing concept
- Finally got funding
- Emotionally invested
- Resist change even when necessary

**Professor's Advice:**

"If you start a company, hire some older person to be your Chief Operating Officer. They have been through a lot. You're smarter than they are, you know more about the idea, but they have to push you in the direction you need to go."

---

## Supply Chain Management

### Definition

Managing the entire chain of suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to ensure smooth operations.

### Importance as a Tactic

**Example: Silicon Shortage (2012)**

- Silicon used in both semiconductors and solar panels
- Tax law changed → semiconductor industry ordered massive amounts of silicon
- Created supply shortage
- Affected solar panel industry
- Companies in unrelated industries had to be aware of supply chain issues

**Key Learning:** Supply chain disruptions can affect your strategy even if you're not directly involved in the problematic sector.

### Car Manufacturing Example

**Porsche:**

- Doesn't make their own tires
- Buys Pirelli tires (some of best tires in world)
- **Pirelli's supply chain:** Must source:
  - Rubber (best quality)
  - Coating materials
  - Other components
- Must ensure no supply chain backups

**When Tactics Affect Strategy:**

If supply chain management (tactic) fails, Chief Strategy Officer and CEO must be informed immediately - it becomes a strategic problem.

---

## Buy or Build Decision

### Strategic Choice Framework

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Need New Capability] --> B{Buy or Build?}
    B --> C[BUILD: Develop internally]
    B --> D[BUY: Acquire company/technology]
    C --> E[Pros: Control, Custom fit]
    C --> F[Cons: Time, Resources, Risk]
    D --> G[Pros: Speed, Proven solution]
    D --> H[Cons: Cost, Integration challenges]
```

**Context:** "Everybody's in AI now, everybody."

**Question for Any New Business Area:**

- Build capability yourself?
- Buy existing company/technology?

**Example Consideration:**

- Microsoft and OpenAI: Microsoft chose strategic partnership/investment rather than building from scratch

---

## Aligning Strategy with Firm Capabilities

### Critical Principle

Strategy must align with your firm's capabilities, or you must change capabilities (hire different people).

### Hospital Example

**Scenario:** Hospital with small emergency room but amazing neurological center

**Strategic Question:** When getting customers (patients), what should be biggest part of strategy?

**Answer:** Promote neurological center - align with what you're best at

**Key Elements:**

- Focus on strengths
- Hire/retain best doctors in specialty
- Market distinctive capabilities

### The Discipline Challenge

**Most Difficult Aspects of Strategy:**

1. Implementation
2. Discipline to stick with strategy
3. Actively choosing what NOT to do

**Professor's Role (as COO):**

"I'm the old grouchy guy that keeps everybody from doing crazy things."

**CEO vs. COO Dynamic:**

- CEO: Wants to do everything, be everywhere
- COO: Pulls back, maintains focus
- Example: Solar/wind/hydro development company
  - Can't be everywhere in Africa
  - Don't have money or manpower
  - Some African locations not suitable
  - Must maintain strategic focus
- "Although we are building a project in South Sudan, that's really crazy, but what can you do?"

---

## Strategy in Different Organization Sizes

### Large Companies

**Structure:**

- Chief Strategy Officer
- Large strategy staff below CSO
- Different team members analyze:
  - Different industry parts
  - New products
  - New directions
  - Market trends

**Strategy Staff Characteristics:**

- For "thinkers"
- Sit around and think about future
- Come up with ideas
- Present to CSO before reaching CEO

**Benefits of Large Companies:**

- Different roles for different people
- Thinkers can focus on strategy
- Operators can focus on implementation

### Small to Medium Companies

**Key Difference:**

"By virtue of working for relatively small to medium-sized companies, you will get involved in strategy one way or the other. Whether you know it or not, or whether you like it or not."

**Professor's Company Example:**

- Very small company
- Has Chief Strategist
- Everyone gets involved in strategy
- "We argue about it constantly"
- Constant debate is normal and healthy

**Reality:**

- You may not know you're arguing about strategy
- But you are
- This is part of strategic process

### Everything Has Strategy

```

**Key Insight:** "Strategy is everything. Everything is strategy, whether your company is one person, or whether your company is 100,000 people."

**Military:**

- Where many strategy terms originate
- Strategy is "super important"

**Sports Teams:**

- Every team has different strategy
- Yankees vs. Orioles: different approaches
- Hire strategy specialists
- Sports industry: one of highest-paying in world
- Often overlooked in business school
