## Sources of Power in Negotiations

Power is the ability to control people, situations, and negotiation outcomes. This capability depends on:
- **Willingness** to use power
- **Knowledge** of relevant power sources
- **Ability** to utilize these power sources

**Critical Distinction**: Real control over power sources vs. subjective perception of control by either party.

### External Sources of Power

    G --> G1[Provides confidence & security]
    G --> G2[Reduces uncertainty]
    G --> G3[Enhanced threat credibility]
```

#### 1. Economic Means
- Reduces dependency on the other party
- Eliminates time pressure
- Facilitates alternative options to negotiations
- Enables achieving higher goals

#### 2. Social/Organizational/Political Status
- Using status to impose solutions
- Different status levels typically lead to competitive negotiations with multiple attempts to impose solutions
- Similar status levels among negotiation managers push toward cooperative negotiations

#### 3. Time Control
- Controlling the timing and pace of negotiations
- Setting deadlines and schedules

#### 4. Technology
- Can provide new solutions and alternatives

#### 5. Controlling Bureaucracy
- When a negotiating party controls bureaucratic systems
- When alternatives to negotiations mean getting entangled in bureaucracy for the other party

#### 6. Reputation
- High reputation provides confidence and security to the other party
- Reduces uncertainty for the other party
- When a party is known for following through on threats, the effect is more pronounced

### Internal Sources of Power

#### 1. Alternatives to Negotiations
- Parties with more alternatives show less dependency
- Negotiations become less critical, leading to better outcomes

#### 2. Coalition
- Binding multiple partners as an integrated negotiating party
- Increases resources, allows better risk distribution, provides mutual support
- Enables achieving higher goals and managing riskier moves
- **Risk**: Internal disagreements can lead to "divide and conquer" tactics by the other party

#### 3. Investment & Commitment
- **"Addiction Phenomenon"**: The more resources (money, time, effort) invested, the more willing a party becomes to make concessions
- **Relationship Commitments**: Commitments to relationships or outcomes weaken the committed party

#### 4. Information
- Knowledge about prices for other buyers, production scales, sales volumes, cost prices, customer complaints
- Critical in supplier-buyer negotiations

### Personal Sources of Power

#### 1. Weakness
- Weak negotiators have nothing to lose, making it difficult to change their position
- Weakness generates public/media sympathy that can be utilized
- Example: Party A doesn't know that Party B's chief negotiator lacks sufficient organizational strength

#### 2. Expertise
- Expert opinion can convince or block the other party's arguments
- **Strategic Warning**: Bringing in world experts only makes sense if the probability of the other party bringing counter-experts is low

#### 3. Charisma
- Easy identification and admiration leads to willingness to imitate and broad support
- Example: Bringing someone famous who doesn't need to be an expert but needs to be someone the other party can rely on

### Sources of Power in Socialization

#### 1. The Power of the Written Word
- The party formulating the agreement draft has substantial advantage
- The draft dictates the continuation of negotiations

#### 2. Precedent
- Past commercial negotiation terms can serve as precedent
- "Why should we accept less than others?"

#### 3. Justice
- Belief in fairness and just demands becomes a power source
- Encourages parties to harden their positions
- Exists between states but not between companies

    D --> D4[Allow weaker party gains]
    
    style B fill:#ffcccc
    style C fill:#ccffcc
    style D fill:#ffffcc
```

### Battle Strategy
**Characteristics:**
- "I'm on one side, you're on the other"
- Aggressive pushing to the red line
- Likely when one party is significantly stronger than the other
- Negotiations are harsh and aggressive
- The other party is viewed as an enemy or opponent

**Tactics:**
- Threats, intimidation, breaking contact
- Effective when there's no balance of power
- Risk: Can escalate conflict if the other party responds harshly

### Cooperation Strategy
**Characteristics:**
- Optimal results when both parties implement this approach
- Neither party attempts to push the other to red lines
- Parties of similar size and position
- Focus on mutual concessions in exchange for achievements in other dimensions

**Tactics:**
- Mutual consultations, concessions, promises
- Results are optimal
- Risk: Requires some disclosure, including revealing weaknesses

### Combined Strategy
**Characteristics:**
- Parties use both battle and cooperation strategies at different stages
- Stronger party starts aggressively (battle strategy)
- When the weaker party is pushed close to red lines, switches to cooperation
- Allows the weaker party to achieve some gains

**Critical Warning**: Avoid starting with cooperation and switching to battle at advanced stages, as this likely causes antagonism and may make the other party feel "offended" and leave.

## Negotiation Tactics

### Tough Tactics

#### 1. Threat
- Expression of willingness to damage the other party in the future
- Specifies conditions under which damage will occur
- Effectiveness depends on ability to damage and degree of credibility

#### 2. Intimidation
- Performing disturbing/annoying actions that cause immediate pain
- Damage is felt immediately with no doubt about credibility
- Example: Strike occurring during negotiations
- Usually causes harsher reaction than threats

#### 3. Assault
**Three methods:**
- Presenting positions aggressively
- Attacking the other party's positions
- Attacking the other party personally

#### 4. Ultimatum - "Take it or Leave it"
- Problem: No way to back down ("climbing a tall tree without a ladder")
- May anger the other party and cause resistance
- Perceived as illegitimate or discriminatory

#### 5. Stopping Communication/Contact
- Exiting the negotiation table, silence, temporary continuation, or consultation breaks
- Heavy tactic that creates pressure
- **Counter-tactic**: Other party can apologize for unclear communication, suggest social break, or request private one-on-one conversation

### Time-Related Tactics

#### 1. Temporary Negotiation Stoppage
- Limited time stoppage with established deadlines
- Creates pressure, allows adaptation to initially unacceptable ideas
- Pushes other party toward deadline when conflict cost becomes too expensive

#### 2. Setting Deadlines
- **Natural Deadline**: Contract expiration, agreement expiration
- **Artificial Deadline**: Determined independently as pressure means

#### 3. Setting Daily Schedule
- Determines which issues will be discussed and time allocation
- Creates time pressure for specific issues

### Authority-Related Tactics

#### Limited Authority
- Prevents pressure on negotiation managers
- Allows patience, consultation before important decisions
- Slows process until final decision
- Related to Addiction Phenomenon

### Persuasion Tactics
- Convincing the other party about factual situation
- Appealing to reason/logic or emotions
- Presenting facts and documents
- Convincing that agreeing serves their interests
- Convincing that their demands are useless
- **Persuasion through investment**: Other party considers they've invested too much to justify withdrawal

### Soft Tactics

#### 1. Concessions
**Approach #1:**
- Start with higher demands
- Make minimal concessions
- Set concession limits as high as possible
- Don't give up

**Approach #2:**
- One party ready to make concessions only if the other party also makes concessions
- Higher willingness when:
  - Knowing the other party and empathy
  - Perceiving the other party as very strong
  - When both parties exert pressure
  - When managers believe agreement results are beneficial

**Cultural Note**: In Far Eastern and Muslim cultures, concessions may be interpreted as "weakness." Start with high demands and make slow, small concessions.

#### 2. Active Listening and Promises
- **Active Listening**: Satisfies the other party's need to be heard and understood
- Creates cooperative atmosphere
- Gives the other party feeling of being understood
- **Promises**: Expression of willingness to compensate the other party for "acceptable" behavior

---

## Stages of the Negotiation Process

### Stage #1: Preparations
**Key Elements:**
- Data collection
- Determining initial negotiation goals, including "compromise limits"
- Schedule of priorities
- Determining negotiation location
- Time schedule, cultural characteristics, understanding influencing forces, market conditions

**Confidentiality**: Each party should not share preparations with the other party before negotiations begin.

### Stage #2: Presenting and Rationalizing Initial Goals
**Key Elements:**
- Each party presents goals with appropriate explanations
- Rationalization strengthens positions and persuades the other party
- Tests extent to which positions may be accepted

**Important Considerations:**
- Start with "social chatter" to create comfortable atmosphere
- Build personal chemistry and mutual trust
- Don't reveal all background details or power sources immediately
- Be ready to "spice up" with additional details if needed

### Stage #3: Bargaining Stage
- Each party applies various tactics to motivate the other party
- Evaluates value of different alternative solutions

### Stage #4: Conclusion Stage
**Key Elements:**
- Combining final proposals and agreements
- Evaluating agreement by:
  - Cost-benefit ratio
  - Whether agreement is best result for both parties
  - Agreement durability

### Types of Negotiations

```mermaid

    A[Types of Negotiations] --> B[One-Time Negotiation]
    A --> C[Long-Term Ongoing Negotiations]
    
    B --> B1[No previous history/relationships]
    B --> B2[No future relationship expectations]
    B --> B3[Tendency toward immediate high goals]

    C --> C4[Push toward concessions]
    C --> C5[Part of ongoing relationships]
    
    style B fill:#ffe6e6
    style C fill:#e6f3ff
```

#### One-Time Negotiation
- No previous history/relationships between parties
- No expectations that results will affect future relationships

#### Long-Term Ongoing Negotiations
- Both parties have complex sets of interests
- Multiple ways to reach agreement
- Fear of harming long-term relationships pushes toward concessions

---

## Communication and Information

### The Difference Between Interests and Goals
- **Negotiations focus on goals**
- **Interests are motivation and driving force**
- Parties rarely fully achieve initial goals but can realize their interests
- **Solution achieved when interests are satisfied, not necessarily when goals are reached**

### The Nature of Conflict
- Conflict of interests arising from competition for limited resources
- **Conflict exists when parties perceive situation as conflict of interests**
- **Subjective observation in parties' minds is important, not necessarily objective situation**

### Information Gathering and Processing

#### Main Goals:
- Recognizing opportunities and foreseen risks
- Identifying parties' strengths and weaknesses
- Minimizing uncertainty
- **Result**: Maximizing ability to make correct decisions

#### Data Categories:
1. **Objective data**
2. **Data on the other side**
3. **Data on our side**

#### Sources of Data:
- **Questioning**: Self-questioning, questioning other party, other negotiators, experts
- **Written Information**: Official publications, stock exchange reports, annual/quarterly reports, audit reports, articles, interviews
- **Previous Negotiations**: Information about possible lawsuits, negotiation methods, agreement types
- **Tests and Checks**: Identifying other party's advantages and disadvantages
- **Intelligence Information**

#### Difficulties in Data Collection:
- **Contradictory Information**: Ignored when contradicting adopted concepts
- **Complexity**: Harder to remember = more likely to be rejected
- **Too Much Information**: "Can't see the forest for the trees"
- **Prior Information**: Can harm negotiation efforts and suppress demand levels

---

## Emotions and Moods in Negotiations

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Positive Mood:
- Mobilizes party to remember positive situations
- Provides "credit points" to the other party
- Increases willingness to be persuaded
- More cooperation and mutual satisfaction

#### Negative Mood:
- Records "negative points" against the other party
- More defensive approach
- Deeper, more systematic data processing
- Less trust and attention to other party's interests

### Influence Mechanisms

#### 1. "Contamination" Assumption
- Emotions of one party generate similar emotions in the other party

#### 2. "Signals" Assumption
- Through demonstrating feelings, negotiators understand the other party's intentions

#### 3. "Incentive" Assumption
- Emotions serve as incentives to continue relationships or terminate negotiations

### Practical Applications

#### Positive Emotions:
- **On Negotiators**: More ready to be persuaded, process data less systematically, more cooperative
- **On Relationships**: Positive signals interpreted as satisfaction, reducing worry about stalemate

#### Negative Emotions:
- **On Negotiators**: Less optimistic, more defensive, reject more proposals, process data more systematically
- **On Relationships**: Dominant effect is rejecting proposals that could bring mutual economic benefit

#### Tactical Manipulation:
- **Manipulative use of positive emotions** is more acceptable than negative emotions
- **Pragmatic Level**: Emotions signal need to change behavior patterns
- **Symbolic Level**: Expression of negative feelings may symbolize absence of power balance

## Cross-Cultural Negotiations: Focus on China

### Key Preparation Elements

#### 1. Translator
- **Recommendation**: Bring your own translator
- **Risk**: Chinese hosts may provide translator who filters and reviews what's said
- Use simple English, no slang or loose translations
- Short sentences and professional translator

#### 2. Material Preparation
- Prepare written printed materials for Chinese side before meeting
- Chinese communicate well through writing/reading
- **Recommendation**: Translate materials to Chinese with high-quality translation
- **Print in black and white only** to avoid hidden meanings/undertones

### Decision-Making Process

#### Consolidating Decisions
- Most Chinese (except those raised in the West) rely on personal experience and subjective feelings
- **Important**: Invest in building personal connections and relationships

#### Group Decisions
- Decisions made by highest-ranking leader but require consensus of negotiation team members
- Group decision-making is common in China
- Even quiet team members have contributing voice

### Cultural Protocols

#### Business Cards
- Position clearly written in both English and Chinese
- **Critical**: Don't put Chinese business card in back pocket without reviewing it

#### Positions and Seniority
- Formal positions and responsibility definitions are very important
- Coordinate and agree on positions and/or seniority levels
- Throughout multi-participant meetings, only the most senior people will speak

#### Time Management
- **Extending Time**: Chinese tend to extend negotiations beyond schedules for strategic advantage
- **Patience**: Chinese are champions at spreading time and insisting on unimportant details
- **Frequent Visits**: May require many trips to China with significant expenses

#### Signed Contracts
- **Important**: Mutual contract signing doesn't mean negotiations are finished
- Chinese view contract signing as beginning of relationship
- **After personal connection established**: Chinese will honor and fulfill agreements completely
- **Personal chemistry and mutual trust** often more important than the contract itself

### Communication Guidelines

#### Conducting Conversations
- **Knowledge of Chinese Culture**: Understanding language, culture, and history builds trust
- **Negative Answers**: Being direct doesn't mean being polite
- Better to say "I'll think about it" or "we'll see" instead of "NO!"
- **Losing Face**: Chinese will modify facts or answers to avoid offending the other party

#### Preferred Small Talk Topics:
- Nature in China
- Climate and geography in China
- World tours, especially in China
- Positive experiences during your stay in China
- Chinese art

#### Topics to Avoid:
- Political issues: Taiwan, Tibet, freedom of speech and information

### Strategic Considerations

#### Key Principles:
- Talk around issues instead of solving them directly
- Never show anger, always be polite
- Use soft, gentle way of speaking
- **Use the other party's strength** (like martial arts) instead of exploiting weakness
- **Provide "Exit Doors"** for the Chinese party
- Know when and where to exit the negotiation process

#### Progress Management:
- Effectively conduct progress in time
- Chinese side interested in your schedule and limitations
- Share when you must leave and if company management pressures you

```

### Three Key Dimensions

#### 1. Power Differences
**Low Power Distance (Western):**
- Independence, equality, and cooperation valued
- More internal unity within negotiating group
- One person dictates actions, others follow and obey

**High Power Distance (China):**
- Significant dependence on will of superiors in hierarchy
- Emphasis on coercion and power use
- More pronounced internal unity within negotiating group

#### 2. Uncertainty Situations
**High Uncertainty Avoidance (China):**
- Fear of surprises that may lead to concessions perceived as defeat
- **Key Feature**: Seeking sympathetic member in foreign group to build personal relationships
- Use feelings of goodwill, obligation, guilt, or dependency
- **Friendship = obligation to help friend**
- Through personal relationship control, gain more information and predict reactions

#### 3. Individualism vs. Collectivism

**Collectivistic Society Characteristics:**
- High loyalty to group or society expected
- **Loyalty more important than efficiency or achievements**
- Personal goals sacrificed for group goals
- Individual defined by group belonging, not personality
- **Honor expresses individual status in group's eyes**
- Honor has enormous significance in negotiation process

### Negotiation Behavior Differences

#### Goal Setting and Concessions
**Collectivistic Negotiators:**
- Don't rush to voice negotiation goals to other party
- First seek to know other party and understand positions
- Declare high, disproportionate goals and behave rigidly
- **Retreat from initial goals occurs slowly, heavily, and painfully**
- When other party doesn't accept high position, ask for counteroffer (usually higher)
- Negotiations continue from higher price as new starting point

#### Relationship and Agreement Treatment
**Collectivistic Characteristics:**
- **Important**: Relationships that will develop after agreement signing
- Focus not only on conflict resolution but developing derivative relationships
- **Written agreements signed at public ceremonies** may embarrass collectivistic negotiators
- Prefer informal agreements or agreements with interpretable principles
- **Agreement is beginning of relationship**
- Prefer "adaptable" agreements subject to future changes

#### Communication Behavior
**Collectivistic Style:**
- **How message is communicated more important than oral message itself**
- Prefer to bypass questions, avoid precision, circumvent problems
- Avoid direct confrontation with other party
- **Don't bargain on issues related to personal or group honor**
- High social status individuals typically don't bargain, even at high cost
- **Reason**: Bargaining doesn't correspond to their high honor

#### Concept of Time
**Collectivistic Society:**
- Time accuracy, schedules, and efficiency don't matter
- **Most important**: Social system and relationships between parties
- When long-term relationships important, immediate short-term achievement less important than establishing mutual trust
- **Reasons for extending negotiations:**
  - Need to show "good/conscientious" and rigid position representation
  - Need to receive and assimilate information as perfectly as possible
  - Fear of fast process leading to shameful mistakes
  - Desire to establish personal relationships
  - Absence of time pressure feeling
  - Tactical process dragging (intentional, expressing dissatisfaction)
