3. **Working Capital Management**: Managing short-term assets and liabilities
4. **Dividend Policy**: Deciding how much to pay shareholders
5. **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating financial risks

### Core Principles

- **Market Efficiency**: Markets reflect all available information

## Financial Statements

### Income Statement

The Income Statement shows a company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period.

#### Key Components

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Revenue] --> B[Gross Profit]
    C[COGS] --> B
    B --> D[Operating Income]
    E[Operating Expenses] --> D
    D --> F[EBIT]
    G[Interest Expense] --> H[EBT]
    F --> H
    H --> I[Net Income]
    J[Taxes] --> I
    I --> K[Dividends]
    I --> L[Retained Earnings]
```

#### Example Income Statement
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Revenue | $25M |
| COGS | $9M |
| **Gross Profit** | **$16M** |
| Operating Expenses | $5M |
| **Operating Income** | **$11M** |
| Interest Expense | $500K |
| **EBT** | **$10.5M** |
| Taxes (30%) | $3.15M |
| **Net Income** | **$7.35M** |
| Dividends | $3M |
| **Retained Earnings** | **$4.35M** |

#### Key Calculations

**Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS**
- $25M - $9M = $16M

**Operating Income = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses**
- $16M - $5M = $11M

**Net Income = Operating Income - Interest - Taxes**
- $11M - $500K - $3.15M = $7.35M

**Earnings Per Share (EPS) = Net Income / Shares Outstanding**
- $7.35M / 50,000 = $147

**P/E Ratio = Stock Price / EPS**
- $100 / $147 = 0.68

### Balance Sheet

The Balance Sheet shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time.

#### Key Components

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Assets] --> B[Current Assets]
    A --> C[Fixed Assets]
    D[Liabilities] --> E[Current Liabilities]
    D --> F[Long-term Debt]
    G[Equity] --> H[Common Stock]
    G --> I[Retained Earnings]
    
    A --> J[Total Assets]
    D --> K[Total Liabilities]
    G --> L[Total Equity]
    
    J --> M[Assets = Liabilities + Equity]
    K --> M
    L --> M
```

#### Example Balance Sheet
| Assets | Amount | Liabilities & Equity | Amount |
|--------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Current Assets | $2M | Current Liabilities | $1M |
| Fixed Assets | $3.5M | Long-term Debt | $1.2M |
| **Total Assets** | **$5.5M** | **Total Liabilities** | **$2.2M** |
| | | Common Stock | $1M |
| | | Retained Earnings | $2.3M |
| | | **Total Equity** | **$3.3M** |

#### Key Ratios

**Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities**
- $2M / $1M = 2.0

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity**
- $1.2M / $3.3M = 0.36

## Capital Structure

Capital structure refers to the mix of debt and equity used to finance a company's operations and growth.

### Types of Financing

#### 1. Debt Financing
- **Secured Debt**: Backed by collateral
- **Unsecured Debt**: Not backed by collateral
- **Convertible Bonds**: Can be converted to equity
- **Senior Debt**: Higher priority in bankruptcy

#### 2. Equity Financing
- **Common Stock**: Voting rights, residual claims
- **Preferred Stock**: Fixed dividends, priority over common stock
- **Convertible Preferred**: Can be converted to common stock

### Capital Structure Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Capital Structure Hierarchy] --> B[Senior Secured Debt]
    A --> C[Senior Unsecured Debt]
    A --> D[Subordinated Debt]
    A --> E[Preferred Stock]
    A --> F[Common Stock]
    
    B --> G[Highest Priority]
    C --> H[High Priority]
    D --> I[Medium Priority]
    E --> J[Low Priority]
    F --> K[Lowest Priority]
```

### Optimal Capital Structure

The optimal capital structure balances:
- **Tax Benefits**: Interest payments are tax-deductible

## Investment Decisions

### Capital Budgeting

#### Net Present Value (NPV)
**NPV = Σ(CFt / (1+r)^t) - Initial Investment**

#### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
**IRR = Rate where NPV = 0**

#### Payback Period
**Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow**

### Investment Criteria

1. **NPV > 0**: Accept the project
2. **IRR > Cost of Capital**: Accept the project
3. **Payback Period < Target**: Accept the project

## Key Formulas and Calculations

### Financial Ratios

| Ratio | Formula | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Current Ratio** | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | Liquidity |
| **Quick Ratio** | (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities | Liquidity |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Total Debt / Total Equity | Leverage |
| **ROE** | Net Income / Shareholders' Equity | Profitability |
| **ROA** | Net Income / Total Assets | Profitability |
| **EPS** | Net Income / Shares Outstanding | Per Share |
| **P/E Ratio** | Stock Price / EPS | Valuation |

### Time Value of Money

**Present Value = Future Value / (1 + r)^t**
**Future Value = Present Value × (1 + r)^t**

**Example:**
- $100 today at 10% interest
- **Future Value in 1 year: $110**
- **Present Value of $110 in 1 year: $100**
